# Freedom of Information (Cabinet Office)

This is a dashboard cross-referencing 2010-2019 [Cabinet Office FOI Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-foi-statistics) with [WhatDoTheyKnow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com) FOI requests.

The Cabinet Office releases quarterly statistics of the number of FOI requests received - and how they were dealt with - by central government departments and agencies.

This website helps to explore that data to contextualise WhatDoTheyKnow requests in terms of the total scale of central government requests, and the scale of central government FOI requests compared to other public bodies.
